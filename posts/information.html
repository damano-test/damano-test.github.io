    <p>The way I gather information today is sloppy and uneven. Part of
    the purpose of this blog is for me to clarify how I gather
    information, process it, and draw conclusions. I hope that I can
    take you along for the ride, and perhaps help you develop a clearer
    picture of our present. What are those issues about which Iâ€™m
    curious? I see our society face to face with two big problems:
    climate change and wealth inequality.</p>
