    <p>Rousseau lived from June 28, 1712 to July 2, 1778.</p>
    <p>The first discourse–<em>Discourse on the Sciences and the
    Arts</em> (1750)</p>
    <p>“two poles” for ways of life:</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cato_the_Younger">Cato
    the Younger</a>: vita activa, public life</li>
    <li>Socrates: vita contemplativa, private life, also life of the
    “pre-political savage”</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Politics as “<em>the</em> organizing perspective.” (xii) Rousseau
    regarded “political life as our medium” (ibid.)</p>
    <p>Rousseau was a close reader of <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch">Plutarch</a> (author
    of <em>Parallel Lives</em>).</p>
    <p>In his negative response to the Dijon Academy’s Question on the
    effect of culture on morality,</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>“[Rousseau’s] argument is not that all uncultured, savage, or
    barbarous nations are necessarily morally/politically excellent, but
    that assigning priority to ‘culture’ in the public life threatens
    and, in the long run, destroys freedom and justice.” (xiv)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p>“Moral/political excellence … can only be achieved by everyone’s
    recognizing the shared concern for the common interest or good as
    the organizing principle of their cares and pursuits, in short by
    the education–or re-education–of the passions.” (xv)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p>“it follows that anything that causes the citizens to be
    distracted from pursuing and preserving political freedom threatens
    it. That is why the pursuit of the arts and sciences to the neglect
    of civic virtue imperils political freedom. That is also why
    Rousseau rejects the argument that the unfettered pursuit of private
    interest redounds to the public interest” (xvi)</p>
